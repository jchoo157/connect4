### To run the application locally

- `npm install` to download all dependencies
- `npm run dev` to run a webpack dev server on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080)

And if you update anything and want to keep the changes simply run `npm run build` and it will bundle up any changes and create a new bundle.js. 

You can also run `node server` which will run on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).
